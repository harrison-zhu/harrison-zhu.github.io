    <h2 class="ugly">I want to talk about what water is made up of.</h2>
    <p>Water has the chemical formula H2O, in which it consists of two hydrogens
      and an oxygen. Due to the oxygen being strongly electronegative, the molecule
      is polar. This is different than being a charged molecule, as the overall
      molecule is still neutral, but the uneven bonds make it so that the oxygen
      is slightly negative, while the hydrogens are slightly positive. Knowing that
      positive attracts negative, this allows for hydrogen bonds to form, which
      are strong intermolecular forces that makes water great for organic chemistry,
      and is one of the main properties that allows water to facilitate many of the
      different reaction to sustain life.
