        <p>Howdy! My name is Harrison Zhu and I am <strong>the loudest and proudest</strong> junior here at 
          Texas A&M, majoring in computer science and minoring in mathematics 
          and biology.
        </p>

        <p>I am from Houston. <em>Though it should be noted that I actually do not actually 
          live in Houston anymore and live in Pearland, one of its many suburbs.</em> In Pearland, 
          I attended <a href="https://dhs.pearlandisd.org/">Glenda Dawson High School</a>.
          I did live in the actual city of Houston for the first dozen years
          of my life, and attended elementary school there.

        <h2>Courses</h2>
        <p>
          In order to finish my degree on time, each semester since my sophomore year 
          spring I have had to take 18 or 19 hours to ensure I satisfy the minimum 
          requirements. As such, at least pertaining to my course load, I am always 
          taking <strong>the maximum or close to the maximum</strong> number of credits
          allowed each semester. This semester I am taking 18 credits, with the classes being:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><img class="decorative_image" src="free-computer-icon-956-thumb.png" alt=""> CSCE 411: Design and Analysis of Algorithms</li>
          <li><img class="decorative_image" src="free-computer-icon-956-thumb.png" alt=""> CSCE 412: Cloud Computing</li>
          <li><img class="decorative_image" src="free-computer-icon-956-thumb.png" alt=""> CSCE 432: Accessible Computing</li>
          <li><img class="decorative_image" src="flask-15.png" alt=""> CHEM 258: Organic Chemistry 2</li>
          <li><img class="decorative_image" src="dna-icon.svg" alt=""> BIOL 319: Human Anatomy & Physiology 1</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          I have to say that out of all the classes I am taking this semester, the one 
          I am most worried about is BIOL 319, which is also commonly referred to as A&P. 
          In A&P, we have lab quizzes every week, which typically consists of memorizing 
          the contents of the lab that week. It is almost required for students to start 
          studying prior to lab, as a single lab period is not enough to remember 80 bones 
          or 50 different muscles and their actions, origins, and insertions. As such, A&P 
          is <strong>the class I am most worried about</strong> this semester given the 
          amount of content.

        <h2>Reasons for Taking CSCE 432</h2>

        <h3>Introduction to Accessibility</h3>
        <p>
          Though I have always been aware of tools like screen-readers that help those 
          with disabilities use technology, it has never been something I actively thought 
          about. This definitely comes from a place of privilege where I am able to go 
          about my life without really considering or worrying about obstacles I may face 
          when it comes to accessibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          When taking CSCE 331, I definitely learned quite a bit about accessibility when it 
          came to software and computing as a whole. <em>Although this was just a small introduction 
          to accessibility</em>, it helped ignite my curiosity and interest in accessible computing.
        </p>
        <p>
          When working on our <a href="https://project3-group1-clone.vercel.app">Panda Express POS System</a>, 
          my group decided to have our three accessibility features as:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Language Translation</li>
          <li>Contrast Adjustment</li>
          <li>Screen Magnification</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Though it was fun to implement, I noticed that the quality of our implementations 
          was never measured, nor was it ever graded. Thus, I started wondering 
          if there were standards or laws that dictated the quality of accessibility software, 
          like if there was a specific difference in color needed for contrast or the range 
          of magnification for a web application.
        </p>
        <p>
          Given this introduction to accessible computing, I took CSCE 432 to learn more about 
          how technology is used to accomodate and aid people with disabilities.
        </p>

        <h3>Goals in the Course</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>I want to learn more about the different guidelines and laws put in place to 
            ensure accessibility on the internet and in technology.
          </li>
          <li>I hope to expand my view on disabilities and how they impact people. For example,
            when people mention disabilites, I always think of visual and auditory disabilities, 
            but many people also health-related disabilites that are often not visible at all.
          </li>
          <li>
            I want to gain more experience building and developing accessibility tools, and 
            look into the planning process. More specifically, I want to see how Universal Design 
            is used to plan and design tools.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Other Reasons</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I will also admit that one of the other reasons I ended up taking CSCE 432 is 
            that it seemed to be lighter than some of the other electives when it came to the 
            amount of work required for the class. <em>That is not to say that it is easy by 
            any means given that this class focuses less technical and more philosophical concepts.
            </em>
          </li>
          <li>
            One last reason is that the course just happened to work with my schedule. I was 
            originally planning on taking machine learning instead, but it conflicted with the 
            schedule I had already planned, so I just swapped it for a different elective instead.
          </li>
        </ul>
