    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Howdy! My name is Harrison Zhu and I am <strong>the loudest and proudest</strong> junior here at 
      Texas A&M, majoring in computer science and minoring in mathematics 
      and biology.
    </p>
    <p>I am from Houston. <em>Though it should be noted that I actually do not actually 
      live in Houston anymore and live in Pearland, one of its many suburbs.</em> In Pearland, 
      I attended <a href="https://dhs.pearlandisd.org/">Glenda Dawson High School</a>.
      I did live in the actual city of Houston for the first dozen years
      of my life, and attended elementary school there.
    </p>

    <h2>Courses</h2>
    <p>
      In order to finish my degree on time, each semester since my sophomore year 
      spring I have had to take 18 or 19 hours to ensure I satisfy the minimum 
      requirements. This semester I am taking 18 credits, with the classes being:
      <ol>
        <li>CSCE 411: Design and Analysis of Algorithms</li>
        <li>CSCE 412: Cloud Computing</li>
        <li>CSCE 432: Accessible Computing</li>
        <li>CHEM 258: Organic Chemistry 2</li>
        <li>BIOL 319: Human Anatomy & Physiology 1</li>
      </ol>
      I have to say that out of all the classes I am taking this semester, the one 
      I am most worried about is BIOL 319, which is also commonly referred to as A&P. 
      In A&P, we have lab quizzes every week, which typically consists of memorizing 
      the contents of the lab that week. It is almost required for students to start 
      studying prior to lab, as a single lab period is not enough to remember 80 bones 
      or 50 different muscles and their actions, origins, and insertions. As such, A&P 
      is <strong>the class I am most worried about</strong> this semester given the 
      amount of content.

    <h2 class="ugly">I want to talk about what water is made up of.</h2>
    <p>Water has the chemical formula H2O, in which it consists of two hydrogens
      and an oxygen. Due to the oxygen being strongly electronegative, the molecule
      is polar. This is different than being a charged molecule, as the overall
      molecule is still neutral, but the uneven bonds make it so that the oxygen
      is slightly negative, while the hydrogens are slightly positive. Knowing that
      positive attracts negative, this allows for hydrogen bonds to form, which
      are strong intermolecular forces that makes water great for organic chemistry,
      and is one of the main properties that allows water to facilitate many of the
      different reaction to sustain life.
