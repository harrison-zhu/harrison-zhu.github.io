    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>Howdy! My name is Harrison Zhu and I am a junior here at 
      Texas A&M, majoring in computer science and minoring in mathematics 
      and biology.
    </p>
    <p>I am from Houston, but not really since I live in Pearland, where I attended. 
      <ref link="https://dhs.pearlandisd.org/">Glenda Dawson High School</ref>
      However, I did live in the actual city of Houston for the first dozen years
      of my life, and attended elementary school there.
    </p>

    <h2 class="ugly">I want to talk about what water is made up of.</h2>
    <p>Water has the chemical formula H2O, in which it consists of two hydrogens
      and an oxygen. Due to the oxygen being strongly electronegative, the molecule
      is polar. This is different than being a charged molecule, as the overall
      molecule is still neutral, but the uneven bonds make it so that the oxygen
      is slightly negative, while the hydrogens are slightly positive. Knowing that
      positive attracts negative, this allows for hydrogen bonds to form, which
      are strong intermolecular forces that makes water great for organic chemistry,
      and is one of the main properties that allows water to facilitate many of the
      different reaction to sustain life.
